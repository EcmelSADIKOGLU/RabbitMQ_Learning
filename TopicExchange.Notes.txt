Topic exchange formant : one.two.three

We can use # and * as wildcards.

* for just one part of the topic.
# for multiple parts of the topic.

Note: This will only work consumer queue bindings. Not in publisher routing keys. 

Examples: 

one.# = start with one. Not important what comes after.

#.three = ends with .three. Not important what comes before.

one.*.three = starts with one. ends with .three. only one part in the middle.

one.* = starts with one. only one part after.

one.*.* = starts with one. at least two parts after.

*.two.* = at least one part before and after two.
